# Stocks Exploratory Data Analysis - Clustering Analysis

1. Performed a full EDA on Stock Market data including gathering data from multiple different sources to provide a comprehensive analysis of different stock behaviors.
2. Used the Yahoo! Finance API to collect data, amalgamate it with data pulled from NASDAQ, and later added on additional information to the dataset as Latent Variables by taking advantage of Python Technical Analysis libraries.
3. Created a classification task for the dataset (BUY/SELL/HOLD Stocks) to run classification algorithms on, as well as regression algorithms to predict the Last Sale price of the stocks. Ended up with an accuracy of 99% on regression scores.
4. Found different clusters of stocks on the results of my feature engineering and focused in on these clusters to determine their behavior and derive insights (using KMeans clustering techniques)
